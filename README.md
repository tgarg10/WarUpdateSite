This initiative was born during the early months of the conflict with the aim of countering disinformation and ensuring that reliable information reaches those who need it most.

3. Community Engagement: Our platform encourages discussion, knowledge sharing, and collaboration among users who are deeply concerned about the ongoing conflict and its impact.

4. Counter Disinformation: By providing reliable information and fact-checking resources, we aim to counter disinformation campaigns and promote responsible reporting.
